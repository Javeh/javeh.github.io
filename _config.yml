          I started this project as a way of learning <mark>MySQL</mark>. It is a server-side plugin for the Java edition of Minecraft. It allows users to claim territory for different factions, based on their activity in the game. The more a user plays, the more points they earn, which means they can claim more land. I used MySQL to track land claims, restrictions players set on land they controlled, and player statistics.

          When I was the programming lead for my FIRST robotics team in high school, I managed and created a majority of the code for our robot. The robot this code was written for went on to win an FRC Control Systems Award.
          I feel it is releveant to include because it demonsrates the use of multiple <mark>APIs</mark> and the <mark>Java</mark> programming language.

            As an instructor, I primarily taught students over Zoom due to the COVID-19 Pandemic. My course topics included Python, Javascript, and Java. Additionally, I worked as a support team member, troubleshooting IDE and dependency problems for customers in one-on-one zoom calls.
